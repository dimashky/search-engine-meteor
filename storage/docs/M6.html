Rationale</strong></p><p>The project is a major piece of work involving a significant amount of your time.  It is important therefore to measure how your time is being spent.</p><p><strong>2.	Definition</strong></p><p>	</p><p>A project is an organised piece of work, usually of a business character, in which you strive to achieve a stated goal by controlling the use of limited resources.</p><p><strong>3.	Advantages</strong></p><p>A well managed project usually leads to the achievement of the business goal usually in an efficient manner.</p><p><strong>4.	Action Points</strong></p><p><strong>Timetable: </strong>Break down your project into separate activities, estimate how long they will take, specify what resources you will need, and say what the deliverables from each activity will be.  Draw these up into a plan of action covering the weeks available to you using suitable techniques (Gantt charts or MS Project).  How else are you going to know whether you will get it finished on time? Build in ‘Milestones’ – points where you have finished a chunk of work which you can write up and discuss with your supervisor.</p><p><strong>	</strong></p><p><strong>Risk Management: </strong>There will be several key factors which will affect whether you can successfully complete your research project (the availability of a particular person you wish to interview, for instance).  Specify these up front and say what alternative strategies you will adopt if you run into difficulties.</p><p><strong>Resource Management: </strong>All projects<strong> </strong>include costs, time, money, resources.  Work out what you will need in order to complete your dissertation.  How you organise your time in relation to your other commitments is particularly important.  Remember that carrying out your primary research, reviewing the literature and writing the draft of chapters will have to be managed alongside other modules. </p><p><strong>Implementation: </strong>This is where you find out how good your proposal was! It is the plan for what you’re going to do, but also the way you monitor and control whether things are going well.  Are you where you thought you would be? If not, you need to take action to get back on target.  Do not be surprised when things don’t work out exactly as you intended – there is always some revision and further planning to do, and on occasion, this can be quite substantial.</p>
