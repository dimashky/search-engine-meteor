MODULE M5     CONDUCTING A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS





1.Rationale



We must determine where our new business (or existing business) must compete.  Ideally it would like to compete where there is high return, where competition is weak, demand is sustainable and its technology is robust.



2.Definition



This is a process of matching your ideas against the criteria the company has chosen to evaluate opportunities.



3.Advantages



At each stage of the process there is an increasing cost of failure.  This system allows the exercise of judgement at each stage.



4.Action Points



Chart  M5A shows the development of an idea through four cycles of analysis before moving the project forward to the next stage at which the cost structures are typically ten times higher.  At each stage a decision can be reached.  At each stage a set of intervals is used for making the decision.



The system analysis process can be used for projects with either a technological or a business background.



Chart M5B shows the ways in which new business ideas can be generated.



 

5.Do’s and Don’ts

Do a set of assessments criteria for each stage.

Do assessment carefully at each stage.





6.Thought Provoking Questions



Will the ideas really succeed?

Have I evaluated all the risks?
