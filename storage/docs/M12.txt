MODULE 12EXAMPLES OF BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL PLANS



This module contains examples of various business plans and technical document proformas.  You will realise that there is a good deal of common ground as they follow similar systems of planning.  The aim is to give you a clear understanding of the planning process in various business and technological contexts.



The examples are taken from various international sources.  In each case there is material that may be useful. However, remember that, unlike these examples, your eCommerce Project will consist of a mixture of technical implementation and business and financial information.  It is expected that there will be at least 20% effort in terms of marketing and finance in each technical project and 20% each of technical and finance in each marketing project.



Please use these examples, flexibly.  Be selective and use your own imagination. Remember to adhere to any structure your institution may have given you.

MODULE 12.1MANCHESTER BUSINESS PLAN



We are happy to acknowledge the ownership of these notes on Business Planning belongs to Manchester Metropolitan University.  We thank the University for their help.





What is a Business Plan?



A Business Plan is an outline of the proposed activities and aspirations of the company and what is required to facilitate the activities.  The business plan should be a complete description of a business idea and include plans for the next 1-5 years.  It should explain what the business will do; outline who will buy the product or services and why; include financial projection; identify and assess risks; and indicate how much money (if any) is needed.  Therefore, a business plan will have to appeal to its investors.  It is neither an advertising leaflet for a supposed product, nor a technical description, but a document that will form the basis of a commercial decision.





A Good Business Plan:



Contains everything investor(s) need to know in order to give approval and where possible finance, if required. 

Has practical business planning, not unrealistic claims

Has a clear and simple structure

Is written clearly (jargon or waffle should not be used)

Is brief and gives a clear understanding of the idea/technology that will form the basis of the spin out company.

Is user-friendly.
