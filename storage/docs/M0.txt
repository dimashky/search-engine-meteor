The modules correspond to each of the 12 elements of the eCommerce Project shown in Chart M1.



The output of every project will be a business plan.  The project you choose may have a technical basis or a marketing basis because this is the way the course is structured.  



However all projects must be integrated into a business process.  This is shown on Chart M2.



Module 12 contains advice on the personal development programme to be carried out in parallel to the project.  If it is worth emphasising that all technical projects should contain a minimum of 20% of marketing and all marketing projects should have a minimum of 20% technical content.



The examples of business plans contained in Module 12 all contain the technical element. These plans have been drawn together from a variety of sources.  Please use them flexibly.



Wishing you every success.
